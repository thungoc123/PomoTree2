# PomoTree
In this project, i work with my team, 
UI is designed by figma ( we aren't not good at user interface !) 
We made this project for the club capstone project where we participated as collaborators. 
This project helped me learn important skills such as teamwork, time management, and improved self-study ability.

My position in this project is leader.  
The features that i code:  
- Login 
- Sign up 
- Log out 
- Code HTML & CSS ( home, login, button, ... It's been so long that I can't remember exactly what I did )
